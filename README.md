# Machine_Learning_Concepts


**Python ML Libraries Learning Repository**


This repository is a collection of notebooks created as part of my personal learning journey in Python for Machine Learning and Data Science. It contains exercises, mini-projects, and examples that help me understand and practice key Python libraries:

NumPy for numerical computations and array operations

Pandas for data manipulation, analysis, and handling CSV/Excel files

Matplotlib for creating data visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots 

Seaborn for advanced statistical visualizations and attractive plots. 

These notebooks as a reference for myself while I practice and revise concepts.

**Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

1-Numpy.ipynb

2-[Pandas.ipynb

3-Matplotlib.ipynb

4-Seaborn.ipynb
